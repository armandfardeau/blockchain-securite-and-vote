The blockchain is a tool that heralds a revolution and promises a decentralized, open and collaborative world.

The reasons for the craze for this technology are to be found in the successive crises that our post-industrial societies are facing, a crisis of knowledge, trust, legitimate or excessive mistrust of state institutions. The new answers and questions that the blockchain brings will make it possible to envisage a different future around these problems and in particular around the question of voting, and more broadly participation.

While many experiments and proofs of concept support the interest of these questions, the prospective leads are even more numerous and we believe that the blockchain will be one of the technologies that will revolutionize the uses and systems in place. These experiments make it possible to consider companies involving the consumer, decentralized associations whose shares are subject to permanent voting by their supporters or public institutions managed in real time by citizens.

This revolution is not without its friction points, especially around the environmental issues that the blockchain will have to resolve. It will also be necessary to rethink the algorithms in order to make them more viable at the desired scales.

We must consider the blockchain as it is today, in its embryonic stage, and not lose sight of the many challenges and successes that this technology promises.
