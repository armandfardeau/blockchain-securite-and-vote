# Blockchain as a method of securing collective decision-making processes through voting.

> The interesting thing about cryptography is that we can begin to create institutional models that are no longer based on the fallibility of human authority but are strictly based on code, mathematics and encryption. We can begin to build an institutional reality where checks and balances are protected by firm promises, fundamental mathematical constructs that are simply impossible to break because of the properties inherent in the functioning of information.

Many observers agree that we are entering a period of crisis of confidence in the services offered by the Internet.

Security breaches, breaches of privacy, public opinion manipulation, cybercrime, cyberwar, etc. are nowadays issues that are widely covered by the media outside insider circles.

The time for blind belief in the benefits of the Internet revolution and fantasies seems over.

This crisis of confidence is not specific to the digital sector, it is spreading throughout all
the strata of our societies. It manifests itself in the political field, in the media field, so that the era in which we live is now called the post-truth era. (_*post-factual era*_).

This crisis is already having many consequences in the political field as well as in the economic field where trust is the cornerstone of investment and accession.

Public opinion, legislators and industry players are beginning to appreciate the full extent of the work that is coming up to emerge from a period that may soon be considered as the Wild West.

The work of rebuilding trust, which is only beginning to crumble, will in the coming years be one of the sectors with the greatest potential for growth and innovation. _*Du marché de la sécurité au marché de la confiance*_ (Y.ECHED et O. ARGAUT 2003)

It is in this context that we intend to focus here on the impact that a widely publicized technology could have because at the heart of cryptomonnaies: the blockchain.

If this approach has emerged in the BitCoin movement, it is above all a decentralized approach to contract security with very large potential uses.

Secure and decentralized voting services offer a wide scope for creating new modes of interaction around one of the major challenges of any structured society: decision-making.

In this work we will analyze the perspectives opened by the use of the blockchain as a tool to secure collective decision-making. Through the imperatives demanded by these decision-making processes, we will attempt to assess the blockchain's ability to meet them.

We will also attempt to assess the cost of using the blockchain for collective decision-making with particular attention to environmental criteria. 

Finally, we will illustrate our point with ongoing projects or proofs of concept and provide prospective leads.
