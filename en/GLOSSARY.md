## distributed register

A distributed ledger (also called a shared ledger) is a register that is simultaneously registered and synchronized on a computer network, which evolves by adding new information previously validated by the entire network and intended never to be modified or deleted.
A distributed registry has no central administrator or centralized data storage.

## open-source

Open source designation, or "open source code", applies to software (and now extends to intellectual works) whose license meets criteria specifically established by the Open Source Initiative, i.e. the possibilities of free redistribution, access to source code and creation of derivative works. Made available to the general public, this source code is generally the result of collaboration between programmers.

## Adam Back, Inventor of the Hashcash protocol
Hashcash is a work proof system used to limit spam and denial of service attacks. It was proposed in 1997 by Adam Back.

## mining
Mining cryptomones means performing cryptographic calculations to verify the block chain. This refers to both the machine, the practice, and the person or institution performing the operation.

## proof-of-work
As a proof of work (PoW), the algorithm rewards participants who solve cryptographic puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks (i. e. mining).

## proof-of-stake
In public blockchains based on proof of face-off (e.g., the upcoming implementation of Ethereum Casper), a set of validators take turns proposing and voting on the next block, and each validator's voting weight depends on the size of their deposit (i.e., the face-off).

## Solidity
Solidity is a contract-oriented programming language for writing intelligent contracts. It is used for the implementation of intelligent contracts on different platforms in the block chain. It was developed by Gavin Wood, Christian Reitwiessner, Alex Beregszaszi, Liana Husikyan, Yoichi Hirai and several former Ethereum employees to enable the drafting of intelligent contracts on multiple chain platforms such as Ethereum.

## turing-complete

 ## The circle signature 
 Circle signing is a cryptographic process that allows a person to anonymously electronically sign a message or document on behalf of a "circle". The members of this circle are chosen by the author of the signature and are not necessarily informed of their involvement in the creation of the electronic signature. The only constraint is that they must all have a public cryptographic key.

 ## Effect of common knowledge
 From Common Knowledge Effect, The effect of common knowledge describes the impact on group decision-making of information known to all before the discussion has a stronger influence on decisions than information not shared by all. The effect of public awareness shows that an irrelevant factor - the number of members who know a particular piece of information - can influence the group's decisions. If an unshared piece of information is crucial to making a correct decision, the result may be a wrong decision.

 ## Minor
 a minor is an individual who verifies the transactions and operations carried out by users on the network. He then writes them on the blockchain (public register). Transaction verification requires computing power. As long as the blockchain's computer code is open-source, becoming a minor is open to everyone.
 
 ## Moore's conjecture
 Moore's conjectures are empirical laws that relate to the evolution of computer computing power and the complexity of computer hardware.
