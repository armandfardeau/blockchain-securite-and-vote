## Private blockchain vs. public blockchain

|  | Public blockchain | Private blockchain |

| ![Usage](../../images/icons/settings.png) Usage | Manage simple traces (hash). Beyond that is less relevant given its cost of data manipulation and its limitations in managing confidentiality. | Manage exchanges that are richer than just traces. The absence of transaction fees allows for a larger size of stored data. The management of access rights and confidentiality can be better controlled. |
| ![Sécurité](../../images/icons/padlock.png) Security | The more users, the more security is guaranteed. Generally, consensus is guaranteed by proof of work. | Only validator nodes are allowed to validate a transaction. A consensus of n% (e. g. 2/3) of the validating members is required. |
| ![Confidentialité](../../images/icons/protected-profile.png) Confidentiality | The data flows in a transparent way. Unless disclosed, the holders of the addresses are anonymous. | Only authorized actors have access to transactions. |
| ![Scalabilité](../../images/icons/scale.png) Scalability | Between 3 and 7 transactions per second but one transaction can contain several thousand hashes. | 1,000 transactions per second or more. |
| ![Accessibilité](../../images/icons/settings.png) Accessibility | "Permisionless": like the Internet, accessible to all. | Access to consortium members only. |
