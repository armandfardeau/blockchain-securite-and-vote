## An aspiration for transparency
---

To address the issue of transparency, a solution seems to appear: "show white paw".

Companies engaged in communications actions must be aware that they are hyper-recruited and that they must take action to prove their good faith.

By this we mean making the greatest possible use of evidence, as irrefutable as possible, and establishing transparency as a fundamental principle for the new communication of companies, states and entities sending messages to the public.

To support this restoration of trust, technological tools have been developed: participatory platform, holacratic management, public consultation. The need for transparency is well understood by some stakeholders, for example, these tools are part of the proposals expected by local authorities in the context of major urban calls for projects such as "Inventing the Greater Paris Metropolis".

But if these new methods are not to be a palliative, they must set up a real virtuous and long-term oriented system.

To do this, these systems must be designed in an open way (Open Source) but also respect the principles of security by design and privacy by design.

#### Shared trust: the emergence of the "trustless
 
The blockchain integrates these expectations and exceeds them: it posits the concept of the non-necessity of trust (trustlessness). Originally, this word referred to a person or resource that could not be trusted. But in the context of the blockchain, the term "trustless" means that there are mechanisms in place by which all parties in the system can reach a consensus on a canonical truth. 

Power and trust are distributed (or shared) among network stakeholders (e.g., promoters, minors and consumers), rather than concentrated in a single person or entity (e.g., banks, governments and financial institutions).
