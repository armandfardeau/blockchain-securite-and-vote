## From the status of evidence to the vote
---
While transparency requires proof of good faith, proof deserves attention for its status and the consequences it has on the vote.

#### What is proof?

Proof is a material element (e. g. contractual document, certificate) that demonstrates, establishes, proves the truth or reality of a factual or legal situation.
Proof is also an operation by which the accuracy of a calculation or the correctness of the solution of a problem is checked.
It is this dual nature that interests us here with regard to the question of voting.

#### The vote and proof

The relationship between the vote and proof is, as we have mentioned, dual. Because the evidence must be present around the voting process and around the vote as a material act.

**Evidence surrounding the process:** 
* Reliability
* Traceability

This process must be refuted, i.e. it must present tangible and objective elements allowing its potential disqualification or not.
If the process does not have potential refutability criteria, it is considered corrupt a priori.

**Proof surrounding the vote:** 
* Authenticity
* Integrity
* Confidentiality

Confidentiality is a thorny issue in voting because it is only required in the case of secret ballots. 
Although this is a rarer manifestation of the vote, this type of vote could be the most critical.

Indeed, the purpose of the secret ballot is to ensure that the voter has not been corrupted, or will not be subjected to coercion as a result of his vote. It is difficult to guarantee the integrity of the process while ensuring the confidentiality of the vote. For this reason, this type of vote is less used.

In the current democratic process, the identity of the voter is controlled by the existence of a preliminary list and the presentation of an identity document attesting to civil status. 
This is a very classic recourse to a trusted third party. Indeed, the State plays a dual role here: it certifies the person's civil status and issues material proof, using tools to combat falsification in order to certify this civil status. It also issues a list of legitimate persons to be heard during the voting.

This confusion of roles places a heavy responsibility on the State body, as it is both judge and party: it must guarantee the security of the process, by being the beneficiary of its outcome, and by determining the validation, control and meta-control processes.
