### Public participation in the governance of associations

Associations have everything to gain by implementing blockchain-based voting systems to allow their members to participate in the decision-making process. This would solve the problem of geographical fragmentation of members by jointly maintaining a high level of security and traceability.

All these points respond to the need for transparency that the general public demands.

### Local authority management: the citizen as an actor in the public service

The blockchain makes it possible to envisage a new level of integration of the citizen into the management of communities. Beyond participation through voting, this invites us to rethink the modalities of public service actions.

Many experiments are also taking place under the impetus of Mounir Mahjoubi, Secretary of State for Digital Technology, during a debate organized on July 20 at the University of Paris Dauphine on digital justice and legal technologies.

Following this announcement, we can distinguish different cases of use, particularly in the public procurement sector, which is particularly suited to the dynamics offered by smart-contracts and contract automation. There is also a new opportunity for the transmission of documents.
 
 But the most ambitious use case concerns the porting of administrative law into code form. The objective is to be able to compare the individual situation of a constituent with the applicable rules.

 The long-term ambition is to consider an experiment of a community in the form of a DAO.
