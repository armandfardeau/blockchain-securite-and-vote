## Collaborative project management
---

The blockchain offers a new promise: that of basing one's trust on the human without risk. That of opening up your company to the outside world, without fear of interference, of involving your employees in the decision making process with rules that are accessible and verifiable by everyone.

But above all, it opens the door to mixed consultation, internally from employees and externally from the general public. This dual opening could be achieved by using centralized services, but the blockchain offers substantial advantages.

### Internal management: employee-oriented management

The blockchain solves a large number of problems of holacratic enterprises which is a system of governance organization, based on the formalized implementation of collective intelligence. Because of its decentralized operation, these companies are particularly suited to this type of structure, which requires digital systems to communicate with their employees and enable collective decision-making. By providing a traceable and integrated system, the blockchain would solve the geographical fragmentation problem while maintaining a shared level of knowledge about active processes.

In addition, the operation of the blockchain through smart-contracts makes it possible to record operating principles that can be consulted by everyone and modified only by consensus. Thus, it is not impossible to imagine an organization with reduced or non-existent middle management layers replaced by smart-contracts.

### External management: the integration of the general public into managerial decisions

This new form of business management could allow forms of hybridization between companies as we know them and DAOs. By allowing the general public to be clearly and proactively guided in collective decision-making, the blockchain invites us to rethink interactions with the customer and heralds a new form of commitment around a product or brand.
