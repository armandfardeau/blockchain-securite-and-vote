# Definition: security modality
---

We understand the methods of security as the different methods and means deployed in order to secure.

The security action is initiated by the application of security techniques in the IT sense.

Information system security (ISS) or simply computer security, is the set of technical, organizational, legal and human resources necessary to implement measures to prevent unauthorized use, misuse, modification or misappropriation of the information system.
 
Security is a major challenge for companies and all the players around them. 

* Its long-term goal is to maintain the trust of users and customers. 

* Its medium-term objective is to ensure the coherence of the entire information system.

> "The information system represents an essential asset of the organization, 
  that must be protected. 
  IT security is about ensuring that 
  an organization's hardware or software resources are only used 
  within the framework provided."

Information systems security has the following objectives:

| Objective | Explanation |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Availability | The system must operate flawlessly during the intended use ranges and guarantee access to the services and resources installed with the expected response time. |
| Integrity | The data must be the data expected, and must not be accidentally, unlawfully or maliciously altered. In other words, the elements considered must be accurate and complete. |
| Confidentiality | Only authorized persons may have access to the information intended for them. Unwanted access must be prevented. |
| Traceability (or "proof") | It must be ensured that access and attempted access to the elements in question are traced and that these traces are preserved and usable. |
| Authentication | User identification is fundamental to managing access to relevant workspaces and maintaining trust in exchange relationships. |
| Non-repudiation and imputation | Once the security objectives have been determined, the risks to each of these elements can be assessed according to the threats. |

The overall level of security of information systems is defined by the security level of the weakest link. Precautions and countermeasures should be considered in accordance with the vulnerabilities specific to the context to which the information system is intended to provide service and support.

This requires an estimate:

* The seriousness of the consequences in the event that the risks materialize.
* The likelihood of the risks (or their potentiality), or their probability of occurrence).
