# Definition: collective decision-making
---

Collective decision-making is a situation where individuals are brought together in a group to solve problems.

Decisions made collectively tend to be more effective than decisions made individually. However, there are situations in which group decisions lead to poor judgment.

In social psychology, collective decision-making can be defined as:

> "a convergence of cognitive and visual interactions, planned or opportunistic, where people agree to come together for a common goal, within a defined period of time, [...] in order to make decisions"

Collective decision-making is a broad field of study in which several disciplines are interested, such as social sciences, political sciences, computer science, marketing and management, each of which has its own perspective on the issue.

From the point of view of social psychology more specifically, theoretical applications and consequences are numerous and varied in different fields such as team management, jury situations, politics, etc. There are different types of collective decisions, each with very specific psychological modalities and processes, such as polarization, group thinking and the effect of common knowledge.
