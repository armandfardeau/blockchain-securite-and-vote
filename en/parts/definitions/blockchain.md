# Definition: blockchain

A blockchain, or chain of blocks, is a technology for storing and transmitting information without a control body.

Technically, it is a distributed database whose information sent by users and internal links to the database are checked and grouped at regular time intervals into blocks, all secured by cryptography, and thus forming a chain. 

By extension, a block string is a distributed database that manages a list of records protected against falsification or modification by storage nodes.

A blockchain is therefore a distributed and secure registry of all transactions made since the start of the distributed system.

There are public blockchains, open to all, and private blockchains whose access and use are limited to a certain number of actors.

A public blockchain can therefore be assimilated to a public, anonymous and unforgeable accounting ledger.
