The blockchain is therefore a distributed registry in which information is stored in blocks and validated by different cryptographic and consensus methods. The two main uses of the blockchain are financial transactions and smart-contracting. 
The latter allow to correlate a collective decision making, based on the vote to execute predefined actions.
The use of blockchain raises the legitimate question of energy consumption and environmental impact, so we have addressed the opportunity of standardization as a potential answer to this question.
Blockchain technology is not the universal answer, it has limitations and will only be recommended in specific cases.
