Our societies are facing a crisis of trust, and companies, institutions, associations and other actors in the public sector are already suffering the consequences. 

These harmful effects are multiple, ranging from economic scandal with the financial losses involved, to the general public's disinterest in a cause, or, more generally, in citizen participation.

These institutions are closely monitored and must protect themselves by acting with greater transparency and public consultation.

Voting is the queen form of participation; although it represents the most embryonic form of democracy, it remains the easiest solution to implement on a large scale. 

The blockchain appears as a potential solution to these problems, when it frames this participation process.

The blockchain is a distributed registry in which information is stored in blocks and validated using different cryptographic and consensus methods. It offers security guarantees and its limits are identified. 

While many experiments and proof of concept demonstrate the general public's interest in these issues, the prospective leads are even more numerous and the blockchain could be the driving force behind this change. These experiments make it possible to consider companies involving the consumer, decentralized associations whose shares are subject to permanent voting by their supporters or public institutions managed in real time by citizens.

Many challenges and problems make the blockchain reasonably unusable in its large-scale state, particularly the energy challenge. 

The ways to respond to this environmental challenge are the implementation of blockchains implementing the proof of the issue (less costly energy block validation technique) and the different forms of standardization.
