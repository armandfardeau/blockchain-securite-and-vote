This paper was made possible thanks to the assistance of several people to whom I would like to express my deep gratitude.

First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to the director of this brief, Mr St√©phane Dalbera, for his patience, his availability and above all his judicious advice, which helped to feed my reflection.

I would like to express a special gratitude to Virgile Deville, whose advice and criticism guided my thoughts.
